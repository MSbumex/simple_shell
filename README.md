This is an Alx simple Unix command line interpreter built in C.
This Shell works exacclty like the Shell in Linux distros.

Features

The prompt is displayed again each time a command has been executed.
The command lines are simple, no semicolons, no pipes, no redirections or any other advanced features.
The command lines are made only of one word. No arguments will be passed to programs.
If an executable cannot be found, an error message is printed and the prompt is displayed again.
Handles errors.
Handles the "end of file" condition (Ctrl+D).


Usage
To use the shell, simply run the executable and start typing commands. The shell will execute the commands and display the output. To exit the shell, use the "Ctrl+D" shortcut.
